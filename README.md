Hello, world! I'm Jack Dibachi, a mechanical engineer, robot enthusiast, and avid backpacker. I made my Github account
to serve as both file backup and as a sort of portfolio for my past and present projects. 

I finished my BS in Mechanical Engineering at UC Santa Barbara in June 2020, where I first found my love for robotics. 
While I was there, I took some advanced elective courses in nonlinear phenomena, computerized controls, and robotic planning. 
Some of my files from those courses are on here, and others may not be.
In September 2021, I'll start my MS in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford, with an emphasis in Robotics and Controls. 

In the meantime, I decided to teach myself Python, C, machine learning (both with Matlab and Python+TensorFlow), 
and computer architecture. A bigger project I am considering is making my own quadruped robot, stylistically similar to 
Boston Dynamics's Spot robot. You can check out my progress in the repo if I ever find the time to get started.

You can check out some more stuff I've done on my resume. If you have any questions about my work or just want to chat,
you can shoot me an email at jackdibachi@gmail.com or DM me on Twitter @jackdibachi if that's more your thing. 

Later!
