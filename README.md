Hello, world! I'm Jack Dibachi, a robotics engineer based in California. I made my Github account
to serve as both file backup and as a sort of portfolio for my past and present projects. 

I got my BS in Mechanical Engineering from UC Santa Barbara, where I first became interested in robotics, and the many disciplines which come together to make them. Before gravitating towards robotic systems, I worked in a variety of internships and student teams involved with rocketry, magnetic levitation, high energy physics, metrology, and solar energy storage. Some of my old reports and algorithms are in their respective repositories on here.   

I am now finishing my MS in Robotics in the Mechanical Engineering department at Stanford. I not only learned new techniques and algorithms for designing and controlling robots, but I also gained extensive project experience integrating hardware, software, and electronics to create functional robotic systems. 

You can check out some more stuff I've done on my resume and in my portfolio at ðŸ‘‰dibachi/portfolio. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn if you want to chat. 

Later!
