Hello, world! I'm Jack Dibachi, a mechanical engineer, robot enthusiast, and avid backpacker. I made my Github account
to serve as both file backup and as a sort of portfolio for my past and present projects. 

I finished my BS in Mechanical Engineering at UC Santa Barbara in June 2020. I was fascinated with a number of subjects in mechanical engineering, from MEMS and mechatronics to 
heat transfer and rocket propulsion. I found that my favorite subject was robotics when I took a robotic design class my senior year. Since then, I've taken elective courses in computerized controls, nonlinear dynamics, and robotic motion planning. Some reports and algorithms are in their respective repositories on here. I am also self-taught in Python, C/C++, and machine learning in TensorFlow.

Right now, I'm a Product Development Engineer for Simpl Global, a solar energy storage startup based out of the Greater Sacramento area. Being in a startup means my
responsibilities vary dramatically from day to day, but I primarily work on PCB design, mechanical component design, and embedded system programming. 

In September 2021, I'll start my MS in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford, with an emphasis in Robotics and Controls. 
You can check out some more stuff I've done on my resume and in my portfolio at ðŸ‘‰dibachi/portfolio. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or follow me on Twitter. 

Later!
