Hello, world! I'm Jack Dibachi, a mechanical engineer, robot enthusiast, and avid backpacker. I made my Github account
to serve as both file backup and as a sort of portfolio for my past and present projects. 

I finished my BS in Mechanical Engineering at UC Santa Barbara in June 2020. I was fascinated with a number of subjects in mechanical engineering, from MEMS to mechatronics to 
heat transfer to rocketry. In my senior year I landed on robotics as my favorite emphasis, and took elective courses in computerized controls, nonlinear dynamics, and robotic 
motion planning and design. Some reports and algorithms are in their respective repositories on here. I am also self-taught in Python, C/C++, and machine learning in TensorFlow.

Right now, I'm a Product Development Engineer for Simpl Global, a solar energy storage startup based out of the Greater Sacramento area. Being in a startup means my
responsibilities vary dramatically from day to day, but I primarily work on PCB design, mechanical component design, and embedded system programming. 

In September 2021, I'll start my MS in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford, with an emphasis in Robotics and Controls. 
You can check out some more stuff I've done on my resume and in my portfolio at ðŸ‘‰dibachi/portfolio. If you have any questions about my work or just want to chat,
you can connect with me on LinkedIn or DM me on Twitter if that's more your thing. 

Later!
