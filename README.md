Hello, world! I'm Jack Dibachi, a mechanical engineer, robot enthusiast, and Californian. I made my Github account
to serve as both file backup and as a sort of portfolio for my past and present projects. 

I finished my BS in Mechanical Engineering at UC Santa Barbara in June 2020. I've done a bunch of cool projects and taken many interesting electives, but I took a particular liking to robotics. Some of my old reports and algorithms are in their respective repositories on here. I am also self-taught in Python, C/C++, and machine learning algorithms in MATLAB and TensorFlow.

Recently I finished working with Simpl Global, a solar energy storage startup based out of the Greater Sacramento area. My responsibilities varied dramatically from day to day, but I primarily worked on PCB design, mechanical component design, and embedded system programming. 

I've now started my first year as a Master's student at Stanford studying Robotics and Controls. Though I'm enrolled through the Mechanical Engineering department, my coursework is predominantly in reinforcement learning, embedded software tools such as ROS, and the control systems that make robotics possible.

You can check out some more stuff I've done on my resume and in my portfolio at ðŸ‘‰dibachi/portfolio. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn if you want to chat. 

Later!
